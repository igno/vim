My vim collection
===

This is my personal vim configuration. It basically just bundles the following plugins:

* https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git
* https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim
* https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git
* https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git
* https://github.com/bling/vim-airline
* https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree
* https://github.com/fholgado/minibufexpl.vim

With some personal overrides of course.

Feel free to use it but be aware that It's tailored to my personal preferences.

Installation
==
Make sure you have curl and git installed and run:

<pre><code>$ mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_backup_igno && git clone https://github.com/igno/vim ~/.vim && ~/.vim/setup.sh
</code></pre>
