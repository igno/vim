# My vim collection

This is my personal vim configuration. It basically just bundles a few plugins and configures them the way i prefer it.

Feel free to use it but be aware that It's tailored to my personal preferences.

## Installation
There is a convenince shell script `setup.sh` which will install everything under ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc

Make sure you have curl and git installed (and preferably vim) and run:

<pre><code>$ mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_backup_igno && git clone https://github.com/igno/vim ~/vim && ~/vim/setup.sh
</code></pre>
